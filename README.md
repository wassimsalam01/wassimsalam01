### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- âš¡ Iâ€™m currently finishing up my M.Sc. thesis in Bioinformatics at the Leibniz-Institut fÃ¼r GewÃ¤sserÃ¶kologie und Binnenfischerei (IGB)
- ðŸ”­ My thesis topic revolved around the analysis of Differentially Methylated Regions (DMR) in a triploid asexual Arctic _Daphnia pulicaria_ population, which will be made public here in the future
  - ðŸŒ± I used nf-core/methylseq to analyse WGBS data. I successfully created an insitutional configuration profile for my university's HPC system _Curta_, which can be checked out here: [FUB Curta](https://nf-co.re/configs/fub_curta)
  - ðŸ˜„ Part of my thesis entailed creating a pipeline to compute an alternate reference genome for said triploid asexual Arctic _Daphnia pulicaria_, which is already available here: [Snakemake Pipeline](https://github.com/wassimsalam01/snakemake-triploid-alt-ref-genome-pipeline)
